        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello! My name is Ahmad Dayeh, and I am currently in my second year in the US. I attend Taft High School.</p>
        
        <p>My academic journey has been marked by significant achievements, including being recognized by the Illinois Student Aid Commission (ISAC) and being a Posse Scholarship finalist.</p>

        <p>I am passionate about physics and aspire to become a theoretical physicist in the future. I will be majoring in physics, driven by my love for understanding the fundamental principles of the universe.</p>

        <p>Outside of academics, one of my favorite things to do is learn more about physics, and I enjoy watching documentaries about new discoveries in the field. The exploration of the unknown and the pursuit of knowledge are what fuel my curiosity and drive.</p>
